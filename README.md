# PPMA BEST

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

As a current employee of the PPMA Group of Associations a need has been highlighted to update the exisiting website for the charitable branch of the organisation - PPMA BEST.

The existing site was created a number of years ago and as such, is dated in its appearance and is not responsive for smaller screens.

The current PPMA BEST website can be found [here](http://www.ppmabest.org.uk/).
 
## Demo

A live demo can be found [here](https://pengols.github.io/Milestone-1/).

## UX

This website is designed for organisations that are members of, or are at least related to the Processing, Packaging or Machinery industries in the United Kingdom who employ or are interested in employing apprentices.  It is also aimed at apprentices that work for the aforementioned organisations who are interested in investigating the available grants and subsidies available to assist in their education.

The website aims to provide this often complex information in as clear and concise manner as possible, provide an easy method to contact PPMA BEST for further information and to enforce the Charity's branding by using complimentary colours.

### User Stories

1. As a potential or existing employer of apprentices, I want to see the grants that are available to my organisation to assist with their development and the costs to me.

2. As an apprentice, I want to see the grants that I am able to apply for for equipment to assist my apprenticeship.

3. As an active member of the Processing, Packaging and Machinery Association I would like to be able to contact PPMA BEST to see how I can get involved.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
